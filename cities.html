    <p>
      I was born and raised in Denver, and have lived there on and off my whole life. I moved to Boston to attend Conservatory for Acting for four years, between 2008-2012. My junior year of college, I studied Commedia Dell'Arte and Physical Theatre, in Arezzo, Italy. Afterward, I backpacked through Europe and spent a month in Hamburg, Germany working on a farm. I moved back to Boulder after graduation and have been there on and off ever since. In between living in Boulder, I moved back to Denver for a time, and also moved just outside of Portland, Oregon in a small town near Mt. Hood for about 6 months. Currently, I'm living in Boulder after having lived in a trailer for 6 months mainly in California and the Southwest.

    <h1>Top 3 cities I'd like to visit</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Portland, Maine</li>
      <li>Tokyo, Japan</li>
      <li>Seoul, South Korea</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I'd like to visit Portland because Maine is a beautiful and strange place, and of all the places in the US remains mysterious to me. I'd like to visit Tokyo, mainly because it is the jumping off point for traveling all of Japan. The same goes for Seoul. I would like to eat all of the delicious foods from all of the places, but Asia is a good start, continent-wise.
